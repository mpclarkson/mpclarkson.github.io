I've been keeping an eye out for projects looking to develop robust web frameworks in open source Swift.

A week or so ago I stumbled on the very promising [Vapor](https://github.com/tannernelson/vapor) - a Laravel inspired web
framework written in Swift. Check it out and star the repo.

You can build a basic Vapor web app really easily using [this installer](https://github.com/mpclarkson/vapor-installer)
I wrote over the weekend.

Download the binary from the repo, add it to your `$PATH` enter `vapor new ProjectName` at the command line (OSX or Linux)
and there you have it - a blazingly fast Swift web app.

Happy coding.
