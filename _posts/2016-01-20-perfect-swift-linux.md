The open sourcing of Swift was certainly a truly wonderful thing!

I'm really excited about the prospect of using Swift server side as it's such a fun language to program in.

So, over the Christmas-New Year holidays I spent some time playing around with the very promising [Perfect](https://www.perfect.org) server on Ubuntu using Vagrant.

I've published this [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/mpclarkson/perfect-swift-linux) for anyone who wants to play with functional Swift webserver!

Happy coding!
