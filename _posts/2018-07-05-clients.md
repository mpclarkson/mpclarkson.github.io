I've been a couple of months now since Simon and I merged our consulting businesses into [Those Digital Guys](https://thosedigitalguys.com/). We're trading as [SimonDell.com](https://simondell.com) for the time being because:

1. Simon's site also ranks really well for out keywords in Brisbane
2. We are waaaaay too busy to focus on building another brand right now ;)

Things have been going well. Really well in fact. 

We've already hired a few people and are working with some really interesting clients, including:

## TalentVine 

TalentVine is a [recruitment marketplace](https://www.talentvine.com.au). Basically, what this means is that they make outsourced recruitment affordable, transparent and simple. Employers get to piggy-back off the time and costs that have already been invested into hiring similar roles.
Screen reader support enabled. It's a really interesting startup that is kicking some goals.

## DoseMe

DoseMe is another facinating startup we've been working with. They are a [precision dosing](https://doseme-rx.com) software platform. We're doing some really interesting lead generation and [marketing automation](https://simondell.com/marketing-automation-best-practices) work with them. Their [free vancomycin dosing calculator](https://doseme-rx.com/vancomycin-dosing-calculator) is a great example of innovative content marketing (thing bigger than boring blogs!)
