## About

osher.ai is the personal AI for [AI for business](https://osher.ai/). Interact with your internal processes, knowledge bases and data via private or publicly accessible AIs.

Your AIs can be trained on content you upload, such as your internal knowledge base, process documents, or spreadsheets.

You are able to:
- create multiple AIs with access to different content
- customize their name, personality, purpose and color to align with your brand
- tailor their welcome messages
- cntrol how your AIs are accessed and limit access by domain
- embed a chat widget on your website for public interactions, or insert the AI in an intranet for internal employee access.

## Planned Features

Some of the additional features I'm considering building include:
- Multi-user interactions and collaboration with your AIs
- Enterprise API access
- URL / Site uploading - e.g. connect your AI to your own website or government data sources
- Integrations - CRMs (e.g. Salesforce), Accounting packages (e.g. Xero), Google Docs, Microsoft Live
- Interact with your AIs via Slack and Teams

## Tech Stack

osher.ai is built with:
