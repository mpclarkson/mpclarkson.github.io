title: Interesting Clients
comments: true
---

I've been a couple of months now since Simon and I merged our consulting businesses into [Those Digital Guys](https://thosedigitalguys.com/). We're trading as [SimonDell.com](https://simondell.com)) for the time being as:

1. Simon's site also ranks really well for our key terms
2. We are waaaaay too busy to focus on building another brand right now ;)

Things have been going well. Really well in fact. We've already hired a few people and are working with some really interesting clients, including:

##TalentVine 

TalentVine is a [recruitment marketplace](https://www.talentvine.com.au). Basically, what this means is that they make outsourced recruitment affordable, transparent and simple. Employers get to piggy-back off the time and costs that have already been invested into hiring similar roles.
Screen reader support enabled. Really interesting startup that is clicking some goals.

##DoseMe

DoseMe is another facinating startup we've been working with. They are a [precision dosing](https://doseme-rx.com) software platform. We're doing some really interesting lead generation and [marketing automation](https://simondell.com/marketing-automation-best-practices) work with them.

##Knauf Insulation

Knauf is one fastest growing and most respected names in insulation worldwide. We are assisting them with digital marketing for [Knauf Australia](https://www.knaufinsulation.com.au/), [Knauf New Zealand](https://www.knaufinsulation.co.nz/), [Earthwool Insulation Australia](https://www.earthwool.com.au/) and [Earthwool Glasswool New Zealand](https://www.earthwoolglasswool.co.nz/).


A smarter way to dose
Leave behind the laborious manual calculations,
spreadsheets, and complex tools.
 
Ride on!
