I've been a couple of months now since Simon and I merged our consulting businesses into [Those Digital Guys](https://thosedigitalguys.com/). We're trading as [SimonDell.com](https://simondell.com) for the time being because:

1. Simon's site also ranks really well for out keywords in Brisbane
2. We are waaaaay too busy to focus on building another brand right now ;)

Things have been going well. Really well in fact. 

We've already hired a few people and are working with some really interesting clients, including:

## TalentVine 

TalentVine is a [recruitment marketplace](https://www.talentvine.com.au). Basically, what this means is that they make outsourced recruitment affordable, transparent and simple. Employers get to piggy-back off the time and costs that have already been invested into hiring similar roles.
Screen reader support enabled. It's a really interesting startup that is kicking some goals.

## DoseMe

DoseMe is another facinating startup we've been working with. They are a [precision dosing](https://doseme-rx.com) software platform. We're doing some really interesting lead generation and [marketing automation](https://simondell.com/marketing-automation-best-practices) work with them.

## Knauf Insulation

Knauf is one fastest growing and most respected names in insulation worldwide. We are assisting them with digital marketing for [Knauf Australia](https://www.knaufinsulation.com.au/), [Knauf New Zealand](https://www.knaufinsulation.co.nz/), [Earthwool Insulation Australia](https://www.earthwool.com.au/) and [Earthwool Glasswool New Zealand](https://www.earthwoolglasswool.co.nz/).

## Prescare

PresCare is a leading provider of residential and in-home care services, in particular [aged-care](https://www.prescare.org.au/). We are assisting them with general digital marketing and SEO.

## Femplay 

Femplay Australia was launched in December 2002 and has quickly become Australia's most popular [online adult store](https://www.femplay.com.au/) for females and couples. We're assisting with digital marketing, SEO, SEM and PCC.

## Mango Solutions

## All Fix Plumbing

Allfix Plumbing is an [emergency plumber in Brisbane](https://www.allfixplumbing.com.au/)  providing good service in an industry that isn't renowned for great customer care. We are helping the owner, James, to build his online profile with SEO and SEM.
 
## True Me
